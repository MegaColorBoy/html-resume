# My Resume
Single-page resume built using HTML, CSS and Javascript that can be viewed on the web and exported to a PDF.

## Why make it this way?
I usually build my resume using LaTeX (Yeah, not a huge fan of using Microsoft Word for things like this). Since, I'm on a time-constraint, I thought of writing my resume using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It allows me to keep the margin and padding consistent, the visual appeal can be easily configured and it's cool!
