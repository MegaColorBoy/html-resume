						<b>Date:</b> Saturday, November 2<sup>nd</sup> 2019<br/>
						<b>To:</b> Human Resources Department
					</p>

					<p>
						Dear HR,<br/><br/>

						After looking at your job vacancy on your website, which I discovered via <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com">Glassdoor</a> Jobs, I got the impression that <a href="kalebr.com">Kalebr</a> is a company
						that likes to solve challenges &amp; a really fun place to work at. Therefore, I'd like to apply for the role of <b>Full Stack Developer</b>, preferably starting from 
						the second week of November 2019.<br/><br/>

						I'm a software engineer &amp; designer with a curiosity &amp; passion for computer science, mathematics, software engineering, digital design &amp; technology. My tagline is always <em>"I like problem solving &amp; building stuff for fun!"</em>. During my free time, I like to work on my side projects &amp; host them on my <a href="https://github.com/megacolorboy">GitHub repository</a> &amp; write articles on my <a href="https://www.megacolorboy.com">blog</a> that reflects on my passion &amp; work. Apart from that, I like to keep myself fit by doing calisthenics &amp; read some books.<br/><br/>

						I have 3+ years of professional experience in developing full-stack web-applications using PHP, MySQL, Javascript and CSS. In my previous role at <a href="https://www.kit.ae">Key Information Technology</a>, I served as a Software Developer in the Marketing department, who was in-charge of handling the company's website &amp; several projects. In addition, I had the privilege of being able to:
						
						<ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
							<li>Handle 5+ full-stack web application projects.</li>
							<li>Write a custom MVC framework</li>
							<li>Build REST APIs &amp; custom tools like an image compressor &amp; caching module.</li>
							<li>Design &amp; build reusable UI components.</li>
							<li>Configure &amp manage Apache servers on Linux &amp; Windows.</li>
							<li>Collaborate with different teams such as Marketing, Human Resources &amp; Projects.</li>
							<li>Train &amp; mentor 3+ interns.</li>
						</ul>

						I'd consider my last role as an equivalent to a Full Stack Developer as I had gained deeper knowledge in both frontend &amp; backend development. Apart from that, it had helped me improve my UI/UX design, teamwork &amp; visual communication skills.<br/><br/>

						I'm a fast learner &amp; have demonstrated the ability to adapt to new technologies. With my passion &amp; determination, I believe that I can be a valuable asset to <a href="kalebr.com">Kalebr</a>.<br/><br/>

						Thank you for your consideration &amp; I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br/><br/>

						Yours Sincerely,<br/>
						Abdush Shakoor
